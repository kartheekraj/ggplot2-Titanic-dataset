# ggplot2-Titanic-dataset
 This an R script for the ggplot2 package, which is built of the very famous titanic dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data . I have used this data set to exhibit all possible data-visualization tools from available in ggplot2, although I have not covered them all I have done most of them. Kindly note that the standard data set that is found in base R has only 5 columns in the data frame however, kaggle's dataset has 11 columns also, a notable difference is default base R data set that is available in R is named as Titanic and the kaggle dataset is named as titanic, please adhere to the case sensitivity as it makes a lot of difference. You need the ggplot2 package to be installed in your Rstudio.
